Previously, we have learn about user interface and how people interact with websites, which is called front-end. We have learnt basic HTML and CSS. HTML defines what elements to be show on the webpage. CSS defined the styling of these elements.

We then introduced a HTML and CSS library, called Bootstrap. It's a library that helps you create a beautiful responsive front-end.

## Deliverable
